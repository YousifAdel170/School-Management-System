# School Management System

The **School Management System** is a comprehensive web application built with **React** for the frontend, **Redux** for global state management, and **React Router** for routing. This system is designed to manage various aspects of a school, including student and teacher management, course scheduling, and role-based access control. Users are assigned roles with specific permissions, ensuring a tailored experience for **Admins**, **Teachers**, **Students**, and **Parents**.

## Features

### User Roles

- **Admin**: Full administrative control, including managing students, teachers, courses, and school statistics. Admins can also view and manage admissions.
- **Teacher**: Teachers can access and manage their assigned courses, view student data, and interact with other teachers.
- **Student**: Students can view available courses and access information about their teachers.
- **Parent**: Parents can monitor their child's courses and teachers, providing an overview of their academic progress.

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Login/Registration**: Secure user authentication for Admins, Teachers, Students, and Parents.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Uses a `ProtectedRoute` component to restrict access to certain pages based on the userâ€™s role. Unauthorized users are redirected to the login page.

### Responsive Design

- The app is designed using **React Bootstrap** and custom CSS to ensure a responsive and modern user interface that adapts to all screen sizes.

### State Management

- **Redux**: The application uses Redux for global state management, allowing for efficient handling of data across different components.
